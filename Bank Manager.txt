Bank Manager
Gaurav work in a bank and one-day bank manager gave him a character P which is already printed and told him to print character P exactly 
N
 times. The bank manager told Gaurav, you are allowed to perform only these operations.
1. Copy All – This operation will copy all the printed characters.
2. Paste – This operation will paste all the characters which are already copied.
Gaurav asks you for help to print character P exactly 
N
 times with the minimum number of operations.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer 
T
 denoting the number of test cases.
Each test cases contain an integer 
N
.

Output Format
Print the minimum number of operations required.

Sample test case explanation
N
=
6

Option 
1
:
1. Copy All – this will copy P
2. Paste – output PP
3. Paste – output PPP
4. Paste – output PPPP
5. Paste – output PPPPP
6. Paste – output PPPPPP
Total operations – 
6

Option 
2
:
1. Copy All – this will copy P
2. Paste – output PP
3. Paste – output PPP
4. Copy All
5. Paste – output PPPPPP
Total operations – 
5

Since with option 
2
, the task is done in 
5
 operations. Minimum operations – 
5
.
